# TLSA-auto-update
Bash script for automatically changing DANE TLSA hashes in DNS zone, after auto renewing Letsencrypt certificates.

In june 2018 I wrote a script for doing just this, and posted the code on my blog: https://www.baaten.com/blog/automatisch-updaten-van-dane-tlsa-records/. Placing the code on Github makes it easier to make changes.
